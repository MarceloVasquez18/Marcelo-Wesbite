    <h2><u>Goal</u></h2>
      <p>To develop and use a technology that can measure a soccer player's kicking firmness <br /><br />
    and overall performance with the soccer ball onto a mobile app.</p>
    <h2><u>Inspiration</u></h2>
      <p>I have a passion for soccer, although I do not have much time to play the sport anymore.<br /><br />
      Building the <em>Smart Ball</em> will be a symbol of my love for soccer and for engineering.</p>
    <h2><u>Challenge</u></h2>
      <th>
        <li>Time Management was a challenge for me because of my level of involvemnet in school and my community.</li>
        <li>Writing code will likely be another hurdle for me since I am completely new to the concept.</li>
        <li>Integrating and building the actual ball presented the largest challenge for me. Getting the sensor package was<br /><br />
        challenging enough, causing me to alter my project slightly to give me a larger opportunity to interact with the sensors.</li>

      <li>How to change scope based on what on what is attainable and focus on the important aspects of a project</li>
